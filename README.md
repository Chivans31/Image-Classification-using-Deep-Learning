# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Techiniques
This project aims to evaluate and compare the performance of
three deep learning architectures—Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNet), and Visual
Geometry Group (VGG) networks—in the context of food
image classification using the Food-11 dataset. Extensive
experiments were conducted to preprocess the dataset, train
each model, and optimize their hyperparameters. The
findings indicate that the ResNet architecture achieves the
highest accuracy among the three models, demonstrating its
superior ability to handle the complexity and variability of
food images. The results suggest that advanced deep
learning models, particularly ResNet, can significantly
enhance the accuracy of food image classification, offering
valuable insights for future research and practical
applications in the field.
