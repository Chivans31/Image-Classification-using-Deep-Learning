# Food Image Classification Using a simple CNN, MyTuned CNN, ResNet 18, and VGG16

## Overview

This project evaluates and compares the performnace of the four deep learning architectures— Simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNet 18), a tuned Convolutional Neural Network named MyTuned CNN, and Visual Geometry Group (VGG 16) networks—in the context of food image classification using the [Food-11 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vermaavi/food11) from Kaggle.

## Description

Extensive experiments were conducted to preprocess the dataset, train each model, and optimize their hyperparameters. The findings indicate that the ResNet architecture achieves the highest accuracy among the three models, demonstrating its superior ability to handle the complexity and variability of food images. The results suggest that advanced deep learning models, particularly ResNet, can significantly enhance the accuracy of food image classification, offering valuable insights for future research and practical applications in the field.
